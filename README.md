# lib-LeMS
lib-LeMS was orginally ProjectChicagoObjects, then libProChic, both which were used in Project Chicago and its predessor, Project I2padams. These two projects were my attempt to recreate Histacom, however with my busy schedule and the plot mess I was never able to complete these.
However the libraries that I created for these I have found useful in some of my other endeavours. Thereful for better maintence, I am adding them to their own repos.
Currently there are aspects of this library that still relies on Project I2padams, and will break with those items not being there. I will try to remove these so that this library can be more modular.
